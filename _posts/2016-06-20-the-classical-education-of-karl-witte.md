  The Guinness Book of World Records names the “youngest doctorate” as Karl
  Witte. By 13 Karl became a doctor of philosophy at the University of Giessen
  in Germany. The record still holds, and is viewed by many to be one of the ‘10
  Unbreakable Guinness Records.’ By 9, Karl spoke German, French, Italian,
  Latin, and Greek. By 16, he was made a doctor of laws and appointed to the
  teaching staff at the University of Berlin. He was the subject of a book
  written by his own father called The Education of Karl Witte, which soon fell
  into oblivion in Germany and became virtually forgotten. By a stroke of luck,
  the only known extant copy of the book was found in the school library by the
  Harvard faculty. In the beginning of the 21st century, the book became a
  bestseller in China, with millions of Chinese hoping that their child would
  become a genius by imitating what Karl’s father did for his son’s education.

_The Guinness Book of World Records_ names the "youngest doctorate" as Karl Witte. By 13 Karl became a doctor of philosophy at the University of Giessen in Germany. The record still holds, and is viewed by many to be one of the '10 Unbreakable Guinness Records.' By 9, Karl spoke German, French, Italian, Latin, and Greek. By 16, he was made a doctor of laws and appointed to the teaching staff at the University of Berlin.

The distinguishing characteristic of Karl Witte's upbringing is the classical education imparted to him at a very young age by his father. In _The Education of Karl Witte_, the father argues that his son's "intellectual training and achievement" was not a result of the "possession of extraordinary native talent by his son" and that the instance of such a success "does not stand alone." He gives examples of other parents who through classical education have drastically improved the intellectual life of their children "always with a similar result." Classical education produces to the inquiring young mind "developed and retained powers incomparably superior to those of the average child."

With its beginning in ancient Greece and Rome, classical education flourished during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, becoming the primary rite of passage for the intellectual elite throughout all the other great historical epochs of western civilization until the advent of modern progressive education in the 20th century. Classical education teaches the student to think clearly and to love beauty and the past. It trains the mind to analyze and draw conclusions. The student learns how to spot patterns and principles, how to solve problems and tie in new ideas. It demands self-discipline and perseverance. Classical education is language-intensive, with reading, writing, grammar, logic, and rhetoric at the center of the curriculum. It is history-intensive, providing the student with a holistic view of human endeavors through the great classics from the beginning until now.  
  
Classical education is _systematic_. Every element of the curriculum is fully integrated, building upon one another. The curriculum is tightly structured, starting at the Logic Stage (5th-8th grades), during which the student perfects the skill of abstracting from particulars, to the Rhetoric Stage (9th-12th grades), during which the student uses his argumentative skills developed at the Logic Stage for self-expression in speech and writing.   
  
Classical education is _rigorous_. Emerson's language curriculum in classical grammar, classical logic, and classical rhetoric is vastly different in scope and content from what is currently taught in schools today. Our materials have been time-honored: We do not use modern American textbooks with their fragmented incoherency and skittish content but the original works of only the great authors that have withstood the test of time.   

Classical education is _comprehensive_. The whole panoply of ideas springing from the reading and discussion of the classics and literature is arranged in the mind of the student through inductive analysis and synthesis, the skills learned at the Logic Stage and extensively practiced at the Rhetoric Stage. The student sees all facts, all ideas, and all arguments with a disciplined attention to their importance and interconnectedness.

  Classical education produces students who reason effectively, think deeply,
  speak persuasively, and write rhetorically. However, the benefits of classical
  education are evident in real numbers. Latin students score the highest out of
  all foreign language learners on the SAT Reading and Writing (college entrance
  exam), the highest out of all 270 majors on the GRE (graduate school entrance
  exam), and the highest out of all takers of the MCAT (medical school entrance
  exam) in Verbal Reasoning, excelling the Chemistry major in Biological
  Sciences and the Biology major in both Biological Sciences and in Physical
  Sciences, according to the National Test Scores of Classics Students.

# The SAT & Other Test Scores

Classical education produces students who reason effectively, think deeply, speak persuasively, and write rhetorically. However, the benefits of classical education are evident in real numbers. Latin students score the highest out of all foreign language learners on the SAT Reading and Writing (college entrance exam), the highest out of all 270 majors on the GRE (graduate school entrance exam), and the highest out of all takers of the MCAT (medical school entrance exam) in Verbal Reasoning, excelling the Chemistry major in Biological Sciences and the Biology major in both Biological Sciences and in Physical Sciences, according to the _National Test Scores of Classics Students_.

In the books _The Bell Curve_ and _Real Education_, Charles Murray explains the high point of high school students' SAT scores in 1963, the lowest point in 1980-81\. "The steep drop from 1963 to 1980," Murray states, " was no minor statistical fluctuation. Taken at face value, it tells of an extraordinarily large downward shift in academic aptitude." 1963 is significant because it was about this time that classical education completely caved in to modern progressive education. The latter emphasized specialization and vocational training ("industrialization and technologies"). With a call for specialization in academic institutions to meet the needs of the wartime economy, American leaders roused its citizenry to industrial action against America's foes in World Wars I & II. America won the wars, but with the technocratic educational system left intact after the wars the scholastic aptitude of college-bound students sharply declined. Attributing the cause of the sharp decline in the SAT scores to a hefty shift in educational methods and practices and a significant decline in classics and Latin enrollments, Murray concludes how the "tools of verbal expression" mentioned previously "...are indispensable for precise thinking at an advanced level." In other words, classical education, which once produced a nation of critical thinkers, needs to be reinstated. In the end, he calls "for a revival of the classical understanding of a liberal education." Whatever scattered bits and pieces of information the student gleans from his education today has to be replaced by a "well-conceived, coherent, sequential curriculum" focusing on a "human development paradigm" inherent in classical liberal education.

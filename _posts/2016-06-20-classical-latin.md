  Latin is an elective at the Rhetoric Stage, offered from the beginning to the
  advanced levels in preparation for the SAT II Subject Test and AP Exam. Latin
  has been an essential feature of classical education throughout the ages: Many
  well-known individuals have been engrossed in the study of Latin, ranging from
  German philosopher Nietzsche to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Despite its
  waning influence in the world today, Latin is still fundamental for other
  important intellectual activities. Latin requires the student to think
  logically as he examines words, identifies the endings, and carefully,
  systematically decodes the meaning of the sentence. Latin students have a huge
  advantage in learning other inflected languages, such as German and Russian,
  let alone the Romance languages (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,
  Catalan, and Romanian) that came directly from Latin. Latin is the source of
  75-80% of all words in these languages; about 80% of the entries in any
  English dictionary are borrowed mainly from Latin; over 60% of all English
  words have Latin or Greek roots; finally, in the vocabulary of the sciences
  and technology, the figure rises to over 90%. Students need the discipline
  provided by rigorous study of Latin to understand English grammar and to speak
  and write with the proper “tools of verbal expression.”

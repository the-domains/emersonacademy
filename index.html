Taken at face value, it tells of an extraordinarily large downward shift in academic aptitude.” 1963 is significant because it was about this time that classical education completely caved in to modern progressive education. The latter emphasized specialization and vocational training (“industrialization and technologies”). With a call for specialization in academic institutions to meet the needs of the wartime economy, American leaders roused its citizenry to industrial action against America’s foes in World Wars I &amp; II. America won the wars, but with the technocratic educational system left intact after the wars the scholastic aptitude of college-bound students sharply declined. Attributing the cause of the sharp decline in the SAT scores to a hefty shift in educational methods and practices and a significant decline in classics and Latin enrollments, Murray concludes how the “tools of verbal expression” mentioned previously “…are indispensable for precise thinking at an advanced level.” In other words, classical education, which once produced a nation of critical thinkers, needs to be reinstated. In the end, he calls “for a revival of the classical understanding of a liberal education.” Whatever scattered bits and pieces of information the student gleans from his education today has to be replaced by a “well-conceived, coherent, sequential curriculum” focusing on a “human development paradigm” inherent in classical liberal education.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-large color-title text-align-center d-b p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="41"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="42"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 color-title m-a" data-reactid="43"><div class="System-font m-a Headline" data-reactid="44"><h1 data-reactid="45"><span class="" data-reactid="46"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="47">Classical Latin</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 48 --></div><!-- react-empty: 49 --><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 color-text ls-t-a-j col-2 col-gap-s m-a" data-reactid="50"><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="51"><p data-reactid="52">Latin is an elective at the Rhetoric Stage, offered from the beginning to the advanced levels in preparation for the SAT II Subject Test and AP Exam. Latin has been an essential feature of classical education throughout the ages: Many well-known individuals have been engrossed in the study of Latin, ranging from German philosopher Nietzsche to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Despite its waning influence in the world today, Latin is still fundamental for other important intellectual activities. Latin requires the student to think logically as he examines words, identifies the endings, and carefully, systematically decodes the meaning of the sentence. Latin students have a huge advantage in learning other inflected languages, such as German and Russian, let alone the Romance languages (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, and Romanian) that came directly from Latin. Latin is the source of 75-80% of all words in these languages; about 80% of the entries in any English dictionary are borrowed mainly from Latin; over 60% of all English words have Latin or Greek roots; finally, in the vocabulary of the sciences and technology, the figure rises to over 90%. Students need the discipline provided by rigorous study of Latin to understand English grammar and to speak and write with the proper “tools of verbal expression.”</p></div></div></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="53"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="55"><!-- react-empty: 56 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="57"><h1 data-reactid="58"><span class="" data-reactid="59"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="60">What Is Liberal Education?</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 61 --><!-- react-empty: 62 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="63"><p data-reactid="64">The Association of American Colleges and Universities describes liberal education as “a philosophy of education that empowers individuals with broad knowledge and transferable skills, and a stronger sense of values, ethics, and civic engagement…characterized by challenging encounters with important issues.” In the early years of the 21st century, many universities and liberal arts colleges throughout the United States reviewed their curricula to include a liberal education or to promote broader undergraduate education infused with its spirit.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="65"><p data-reactid="66">Due to the rising tide of globalism, a liberal education is invaluable in today’s world in producing individuals open-minded and free from dogma, preconception, and ideology; conscious of their opinions and judgments; reflective of their actions; and aware of their place in the social and natural worlds.

Classical education teaches the student to think clearly and to love beauty and the past. It trains the mind to analyze and draw conclusions. The student learns how to spot patterns and principles, how to solve problems and tie in new ideas. It demands self-discipline and perseverance. Classical education is language-intensive, with reading, writing, grammar, logic, and rhetoric at the center of the curriculum. It is history-intensive, providing the student with a holistic view of human endeavors through the great classics from the beginning until now.Classical education is systematic. Every element of the curriculum is fully integrated, building upon one another. The curriculum is tightly structured, starting at the Logic Stage (5th-8th grades), during which the student perfects the skill of abstracting from particulars, to the Rhetoric Stage (9th-12th grades), during which the student uses his argumentative skills developed at the Logic Stage for self-expression in speech and writing. Classical education is rigorous. Emerson’s language curriculum in classical grammar, classical logic, and classical rhetoric is vastly different in scope and content from what is currently taught in schools today. Our materials have been time-honored: We do not use modern American textbooks with their fragmented incoherency and skittish content but the original works of only the great authors that have withstood the test of time. </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="79"><p data-reactid="80">Classical education is comprehensive. The whole panoply of ideas springing from the reading and discussion of the classics and literature is arranged in the mind of the student through inductive analysis and synthesis, the skills learned at the Logic Stage and extensively practiced at the Rhetoric Stage. The student sees all facts, all ideas, and all arguments with a disciplined attention to their importance and interconnectedness.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="81"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="82"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="83"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="84"><span data-reactid="85"><!-- react-empty: 86 --><h2 data-reactid="87"><a data-reactid="88">emersonacademy</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="89"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="90"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="91"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="92"></div></section></div></div>

Taken at face value, it tells of an extraordinarily large downward shift in academic aptitude.” 1963 is significant because it was about this time that classical education completely caved in to modern progressive education. The latter emphasized specialization and vocational training (“industrialization and technologies”). With a call for specialization in academic institutions to meet the needs of the wartime economy, American leaders roused its citizenry to industrial action against America’s foes in World Wars I & II. America won the wars, but with the technocratic educational system left intact after the wars the scholastic aptitude of college-bound students sharply declined.

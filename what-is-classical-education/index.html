<p> With its beginning in ancient Greece and Rome, classical education flourished during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, becoming the primary rite of passage for the intellectual elite throughout all the other great historical epochs of western civilization until the advent of modern progressive education in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Classical education teaches the student to think clearly and to love beauty and the past. It trains the mind to analyze and draw conclusions. The student learns how to spot patterns and principles, how to solve problems and tie in new ideas. It demands self-discipline and perseverance. Classical education is language-intensive, with reading, writing, grammar, logic, and rhetoric at the center of the curriculum. It is history-intensive, providing the student with a holistic view of human endeavors through the great classics from the beginning until now.<br><br>Classical education is <i>systematic</i>. Every element of the curriculum is fully integrated, building upon one another. The curriculum is tightly structured, starting at the Logic Stage (5<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> grades), during which the student perfects the skill of abstracting from particulars, to the Rhetoric Stage (9<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup> grades), during which the student uses his argumentative skills developed at the Logic Stage for self-expression in speech and writing. <br><br>Classical education is <i>rigorous</i>. Emerson’s language curriculum in classical grammar, classical logic, and classical rhetoric is vastly different in scope and content from what is currently taught in schools today.
